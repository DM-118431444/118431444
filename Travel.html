        <h1><strong><center>Portugal</center></strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>I visited Portugal last summer with my family. 
            <br>
        I visited the Algarve which was a very nice place. There were plenty of beaches and the temperatures were 25+ degrees everyday
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1><strong><center>Spain</center></strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>I visited Spain three years ago when I went on a Transition Year trip with my school. Wevisited the very nice city of Barcelona. We walked 20km 
        as part of the gaisce award. The weather was very nice as you could imagine and we visited the beach everyday.</p>
        <br>
        <h1><strong><center>Czech Republic</center></strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>I visited Prague in Czech Republic about two years ago. Prague is probably the city I like the most out of the ones i have visited.
         Prague has very interesting history background. Czech Republic was a country that was constantly raided during war times 
        and has since had its name changed many times. I learned a lot about the history of Prague when I visited because 
        of the several walking tours that I went on. During our stay in Prague temperatures hit a record 
        high of 42 degrees</p>
        <br>
        <h1><strong><center>Scotland</center></strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>I visited Scotland about four years ago. I went with my family and we visited the city of Edinburgh.
        We visited during the Edinburgh fringe festival. This is a festival where over the space of a week there are many 
        famous bands and comedians that perform in the city. We went to watch Neil Delamare perform.</p>
        <br>
        <h1><strong><center>England</center></strong></h1>
        <br>
        <p>I went the London to watch Chelsea play Manchester United in Stamford Bridge about five years ago. I got the tickets 
        as a birthday present. There is plenty other things to do in London like to visit the tourist attractions such as Big Ben, 
        The Tower of London and Buckingham Palace.</p>
